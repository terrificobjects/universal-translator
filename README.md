# universal-translator
This is a python project to create an automated conversational universal translator using the Google Translate API.

To create this file, you'll need some dependencies and Anaconda to install them to the directory:

pip install pyaudio

pip install playsound

pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0

pip install SpeechRecognition

pip install gTTs

pip install gTTs-token

#Install the above after you activate the conda environment. Make sure to adjust the Windows Media Player executable location if it's elsewhere on your machine.
